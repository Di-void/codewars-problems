# Detect Panagram

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once.

For example, the sentence **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"** is a pangram, because it uses the letters **A - Z** at least once(**_case is irrelevant_**).

> Given a string, **<u>detect whether or not it is a pangram</u>**. Return True if it is, False if not.
> **Ignore numbers and punctuation.**
