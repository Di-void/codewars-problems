# Find the missing letter

Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

- **You will always get a valid array.**
- **And it will always be exactly one letter missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2..**
- **The array will always contain letters in only one case.**

## Example

```plain
['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'

// case sensitive
['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'
```

**_(Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)_**
