(prime factor decomposition of a number means writing the number as a product of prime factors)

function decompose(n):
    create pw (power) variable and set it to a default of 1
    pw = 1
    create dividend variable and set default to n
    dividend = n
    create divisor variable and set default to 2
    divisor = 2
    create output variable and set default to empty string;
    output = ""

    while dividend is not equal to 1:
        check

        if dividend modulo divisor === 0:
            set dividend to the quotient
            dividend = dividend / divisor
            
            increment power by 1
            pw++

            skip to the next iteration

        // if the above check evaluates to false

        check if power is 0 or not

        if pw is truthy:
            append (pk**nk) to output
        
        // do while loop

        do:
            increment divisor by 2 if divisor is greater than 2
            if not (if it is 2) increment by 1 because even numbers
            cannot be prime

            divisor += divisor > 2 ? 2 : 1

            check if divisor is prime
        while: (if dividend is not evenly divisible by divisor - rerun)

        // after the above compute is done, we would have a new divisor that is a prime number

        reset power to 0 and start first while-loop afresh for this new divisor value

    after all the above compute is done, append the new divisor/power to output and return it
