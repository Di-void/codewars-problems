function returnMissing(letters):
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

    create a variable to store the case of the letters
    in letters array and set the default value to 'lowercase'

    find first letter in letters array

    convert it to lowercase
        
    strictly check equality of lowercase first letter to original first letter

    if they are not equal:
        variable for tracking case should be set to 'uppercase'

    convert it to lowercase and slice the alphabet from that letter

    create a variable to store the slice

    for each letter after first letter in this sliced array:
        check the letter in the matching index of letters array
        after converting the value in the matching index to lowercase

        if their values match:
            continue i.e skip this iteration to the next one
        if they values don't match:
            check the case stored in the case tracking variable we declared

            if it's lowercase:
                return the letter in the current index of sliced as is
            else:
                return the letter in the current index of sliced.toUpperCase()
